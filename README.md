# 🧠 RAG Agent
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent that reads and understands data from PDF files. Built with LLMs and vector databases, this tool allows you to extract insights, ask questions, or summarize information directly from your documents.

### 🚀 Features
📄 **PDF Ingestion:** Automatically extracts text and metadata from uploaded PDFs.

🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Combines vector search with LLMs to answer questions based on your PDF content.

🧠 **LLM-Powered Q&A:** Uses OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLMs to generate answers from the retrieved document chunks.

🧾 **Summarization & Insights:** Summarize documents or extract structured insights.

💬 **Chat Interface:** Query PDFs through a conversational interface.

🧰 **Modular & Extensible:** Easily plug in different vector stores (FAISS, Chroma, etc.) or LLMs.

# 🛠️ How It Works
**Upload PDF:** Drag and drop or provide a file path.

**Text Extraction:** Extracts raw text using libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfplumber.

**Chunking & Embedding:** Splits the text into chunks and converts them into vector embeddings.

**Vector Store:** Stores chunks in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Chroma).

**Query Pipeline:** User enters a question → Similar chunks retrieved → Answer generated by an LLM using those chunks.
